How to run?
python refint.py "Database=xxx"
python refint.py "Database=xxx; err=0.xxx"

How I do?
(1)parse the schema file, get all the Table_name, PKs, FKs, and store respectively in list. FK stores their name, their referring table_name, and referring attribute_name.  
(2)do sanity check, remove unexisted FK/PK attributes from above lists.
(3)for PK integrity, check 2 things: check null and duplication. use sql like below and sum up all return rows:
select count(*) from T1 where ( K11 is null ); 
select count(*) from T1 group by K11 having count(*) >1; 
(4)for FK integrity, check by left join and sum up all return rows:
select count(*) from T3 left join T1 on T3.K11=T1.K11 where T1.K11 is null; 
(5)count the table size, then after computing the err_rate, the result is written into a table named QM.
(6)it also handle when FK's PK is duplicated. When an FK attrbite is duplicated in corresponding PK, it is counted as error. SQL as below:
select count(*) from T4 where K31 in (select K31 from  T3 group by K31 having count(*)>1);

limitations and more?
bonus is not done.
the program can handle composite PK with any number of attributes.
the program can handle any number of FKs.   
the program will ignore unexisted PK/FK.
