(1) How to run?
python refint.py "Database=xxx"
xxx is the schema file

(2) How I do?
1,parse the schema file, get all the Table_name, PKs, FKs, and store respectively in list. FK stores their name, their referring table_name, and referring attribute_name.  
2,for PK integrity, check 2 things: check null and duplication. use sql like below and sum up all return rows:
select count(*) from T1 where ( K11 is null ); 
select count(*) from T1 group by K11 having count(*) >1; 
3,for FK integrity, check by left join and sum up all return rows:
select count(*) from T3 left join T1 on T3.K11=T1.K11 where T1.K11 is null; 
4,count the table size, then after computing the err_rate, the result is written into a table named QM.

(3) limitations and more:
the program can't handle unexisted PK and FK given by schema. 
the program doesn't use error threshold, even though you can give one, but this parameter will be discarded.
bonus is not done.
the program can handle composite PK with any number of attributes.
the program can handle any number of FKs.   
the program will ignore unexisted foreign key refrence(if T1.attrbute1->T2.attribute2, while attribute2 doesn't exist in T2, then this FK will be ignored).
